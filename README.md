# GRIP-INTERNSHIP

🌟 Excited to Share My Recent Internship Project! 🌟

As part of my GRIP internship at The Sparks Foundation, I had the opportunity to dive into the world of machine learning and data science with a fascinating project: **Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm**.

🔍 **Project Overview**:
This project focused on implementing a Decision Tree classifier on the well-known Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Our objective was to classify the flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

📊 **Steps Involved**:
1. **Importing Libraries**: Leveraged powerful tools like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
2. **Loading the Dataset**: Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
 - Displayed dataset information and statistics.
 - Visualized data using box plots and histograms.
 - Conducted multivariate analysis using scatter matrix plots.
4. **Data Preparation**:
 - Split the dataset into features (x) and target (y).
 - Divided the data into training and test sets.
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
 - Built a Decision Tree model to predict outcomes.
 - Evaluated the model's accuracy and performance metrics.

📈 **Conclusion**:
This project demonstrated a comprehensive approach to building a Decision Tree classifier, encompassing data loading, EDA, data preparation, model building, and evaluation. The results showcased the model's ability to accurately classify the Iris species based on the given features.

I'm thrilled to have gained hands-on experience in machine learning through this internship and am eager to apply these skills to future projects. A big thank you to The Sparks Foundation for this incredible opportunity!
